                 "In ten years, I see myself as an integral part of the company who has helped contribute to the growth and success of the organization. I would like to continue developing my skills and knowledge in order to be able to take on more responsibility within the company."
                 I see myself in a leadership position, helping to lead and develop a productive and successful team. I believe I'm uniquely positioned for this career path I've consistently met or exceeded sales goals in every position I've held.
                 I’m also looking to start a family in the next few years, so I’ll be balancing work and home life. I think that my career goals and personal goals will complement each other nicely and help me to achieve a healthy work-life balance.”
