            <p>My Favorit e Hobby is playing cricket. cricket is my favorite hobbay and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket at the tender age of 4 years. Even at that time, I was considerd a good player in comparison to the chidren of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.</p>

            <p>My hobby is traveling. There is something about exploring new places and experiencing different cultures that I find exhilarating. Whether it is a short road trip to a nearby town or a long-haul flight to a distant country, I always enjoy the journey.</p>
